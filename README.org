* Smart-hungry-delete

Delete whitespace between words, parenthesis and other delimiters in a smart (dumb) way.

Suppose you have this text in the buffer:

[[./doc/demo-00-01.png]]

With =smart-hungry-delete/backward-char=, it will delete all but one (white-)space between =word= and =paren=:


[[./doc/demo-00-02.png]]

If you delete here:


[[./doc/demo-00-03.png]]

it deletes all whitespace, because it's on the inside of a paren:

[[./doc/demo-00-04.png]]

Inside of right paren:

[[./doc/demo-00-05.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-06.png]]

This is configured for =C=-like languages (e.g. Python), where =:= usually has no space to the left:

[[./doc/demo-00-07.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-08.png]]

It has space to the right though:

[[./doc/demo-00-09.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-10.png]]

This also works for (nested) parentheses:

[[./doc/demo-00-11.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-12.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-13.png]]

Between words it will leave a space:

[[./doc/demo-00-14.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-15.png]]

[[./doc/demo-00-16.png]]
